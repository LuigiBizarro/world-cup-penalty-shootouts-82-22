# World Cup Penalty Shootouts 1982-2022

## Project Overview

This project was made whit the motivation is knowing about the a particular type of definition in the World Cup tournament. Spain 82 was hosted the first defintion and until Qatar 22 were thirty five definitions total. The data analysis project aims to get some outcomes by different information the CVS, for example the side of the shots, player-foot skilful, goalkeeper's dive, performances scores team etc. Thererefore analyzing various aspects, we answers any questions that we elaborate and to show any interesting dataframes from the libraries availibles and programation concepts.

## Sources and Tools

- Kaggle (you need an account if you want to downland the CVS or get it by this repository)
- Jupyter Notebook
- Libraries: Pandas - NumPy - Matplotlib - Seaborn

## First Exploratory Analysis 

1. Amount and average goals
2. Top 5 countries with the most goals score
3. Number of penalties out, saved and scored
4. Number of players left-footed, players right-footed and their success ratio
5. Goalkeeper's choice dive

## Asking and Answering Questions 

1. What is the most player's choice zone?
2. What is the most player's choice zone according to skilful foot?
3. History penalty shootout's score. Does first team have more chances to win?
4. Countries with most appearances
5. Amount of penalties shootouts incompleted

## Inferences and Conclusion

We have tried to show some an interesting outcomes from the the penalties shootouts throughout the World Cup since 1982 to 2022 following any features given for the data upload. We can summarize our study:

- There are more players right-footed than left-footed, and the first have a better success rate and the 'Zone 8' is increasingly chosen lately.
- Argentina has 6 of 7 matches won in this type of definitions but for Germany and Croatia are more effectives (4/4).
- The country which kick first has a slight disadvantage in opposition of the penalty shootout history.
- In overall it scores between 6 and 7 goals and the probability of complete a penalty shootout is 48% (To reach the tenth penalty) and it's odd have over two match points in each penalty shootout (just happened two times).
